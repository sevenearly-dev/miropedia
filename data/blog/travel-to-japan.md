**Kyoto**

5. **Nintendo's Old Headquarters**: While you can't go inside, you can visit the building in Kyoto where Nintendo started as a playing card company.

6. **Kyoto International Manga Museum**: Here you can find a massive collection of manga from Japan and around the world. You're allowed to read any of the manga on the shelves.

**Osaka**

7. **Nipponbashi Denden Town**: Osaka's answer to Akihabara, this district is filled with stores selling anime, manga, and electronic goods.

**Other Attractions**

8. **Studio Ghibli Museum**: Located in Mitaka, Tokyo, this museum is dedicated to the work of Studio Ghibli, one of Japan's most beloved animation studios. Tickets must be purchased in advance.

9. **Super Nintendo World**: Located in Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, this is a must-visit for Nintendo fans. It's a themed area featuring attractions based on Nintendo franchises like Mario.

**General Tips**

- Learn a few basic Japanese phrases. While many people in Japan have a basic understanding of English, especially in larger cities and popular tourist areas, it can be helpful and respectful to learn some simple phrases in Japanese.

- Be respectful of Japanese customs and etiquette. This can include things like not eating while walking, taking off your shoes before entering certain places, and not speaking loudly in public places.

- Get a Japan Rail Pass. If you plan on traveling around the country, a JR Pass can save you a lot of money on bullet train fares.

- Try a variety of Japanese food. Japan's culinary scene is diverse and extends far beyond sushi and ramen.

- Always carry cash. While more places in Japan are beginning to accept credit cards, cash is still king in many establishments, especially smaller businesses.

Have a fantastic trip!
